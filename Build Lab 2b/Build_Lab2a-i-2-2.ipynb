There are different ways of getting the \"true\" risk tolerance. The idea and the purpose of this case study is to come up with an approach to solve the behavioral finance problem using machine learning. \n\nThe steps to compute the predicted variables are as follows: \n\n1) Compute the Risky asset and the riskless assets for all the individuals in the survey data. Risky and riskless assets are defined as follows: \n* **Risky assets** is investments in mutual funds, stocks, bonds, commodities, and\nreal estate, and an estimate of human capital. \n* **Risk Free Assets**: checking and savings balances,certificates of deposit, and other cash balances and equivalents.\n\n2) We take the ratio of risky assets to total assets of an investor and consider that as a measure of risk tolerance of an investor. From the data of SCF, we have the data of risky and riskless assets for the individuals for 2007 and 2009. We use this data and normalise the risky assets with the stock price of 2007 vs. 2009 to get risk tolerance. \n\n* **Risk Tolerance**  just defined as the ratio of Risky Asset to Riskless Assets normalised with the average S&P500 of 2007 vs 2009. \nAverage S&P500 in 2007: 1478\nAverage S&P500 in 2009: 948\n\n3) In a lot of literature, an intelligent investor is the one who doesn't change its risk tolerance during the change in the market. So, we consider the investors who change their risk tolerance by less than 10% between 2007 and 2009 as the intelligent investors. Ofcourse this is a qualitative judgement and is subject to change. However, as mentioned before more than being accurate and precise the purpose of theis case study is to demonstrate the usage of the machine learning and provide a machine learning based framework in behavioral finance and portfolio management which can be further leveraged for more detailed analysis.
