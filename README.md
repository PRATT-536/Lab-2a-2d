This repository contains materials required for Build Lab 2a-2d.

**CAUTION**

Please note that the "Binder" service provides a temporary environment to run your Python code. Any modifications or outputs will be deleted after a "timeout" or "exit.". Please make sure you capture any outputs, or download any files, necessary for your Lab submissions.

* _Note_: Binder is a hosting service that does not require any installation of software. The directories, and their contents, will open exactly as they would open in a Jupyter Notebookno. The connections between Jupyter Notesbooks (Python code files) in the folders will work seamlessly. Most of the time, Binder starts up, loads your files, and is ready for use quite quickly. However, when the "Build Lab" repository is updated, Binder creates a new environment from scratch, and this can take quite some time. Also, the code that processes, and uses, large datasets may be slow.
