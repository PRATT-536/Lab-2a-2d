**BEFORE YOU START**

Note 1: This repository only contains the Jupyter Notebooks required for Build Labs 2a-2d.

Note 2: The Jupyter Notebooks will be executed using the "Binder Service" - not Jupyter. Binder is a hosting service that does not require any installation of software. The directories from this repositorty, and their contents, will open exactly as they would open in a Jupyter Notebook. The connections between Jupyter Notesbooks (Python code files) in the folders will work seamlessly. 

Note 3: After launching Binder, all Jupyter Notebooks in this repository will be available in Binder's virtual environment - BUT you will have to upload the data files manually to the Binder environment.

Note 4: Binder launches, loads your files, and is ready for use quite quickly. However, when the repository is updated, Binder creates a new environment from scratch - this can take quite some time. Also, the code that processes large datasets may be slow - this is due to the size of the dataset and not Binder or Python.

**CAUTION**

Please note that the "Binder" service provides a temporary environment to run your Jupyter Notebooks (Python code). Any modifications to code, or outputs that are created (e.g., Graphs), will be deleted after a "timeout" or "user exit." Please make sure you capture any outputs, or download any files, necessary for your Lab submissions.
