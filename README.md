INTRODUCTION

This github repository contains all materials for Build Labs 2a-2d. This includes configuration files, python code, and data files.

RECOMMENDATION

Use the Binder service to create a virtual environment to run the Build Labs. Binder is a hosting service that will open the GitHub repository, and Build Lab folders, exactly like they open in Jupyter Notebook (Python environment). Binder does not require installation and it will run froom this page. The connections between folders and their Jupyter Notebooks files will work seamlessly. 

Binder starts up quickly andof the analyses require a large amount of data which causes the cache to be slower than usual.

CAUTION 

Please be aware that Binder provides a temporary enviroment. Edits, or outputs, will be deleted -- so make sure you regularly download any modified files.
